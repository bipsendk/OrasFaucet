# OrasFaucet
Home Assistant custom component to intercept Bluetooth BLE announcements from Oras Faucet

Place the content of the oras_faucet folder in out custom_components folder

I am no python expert, and I used some code from another custom component (https://github.com/chkuendig/hass-amphiro-ble) to create this one.
